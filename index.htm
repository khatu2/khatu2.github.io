Welcome to my website!

<p>
<b> About me </b> <br/>
I am from Mumbai, and I am studying Mathematics and Computer Science at University Of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. My hobbies are playing video-games and watching Netflix (Stranger Things rocks!). I really enjoy watching and playing Cricket. CS 125 at UIUC is the first time I am doing any sort of  programming. It hasnâ€™t been easy, but at the same time it has also been a lot of fun. I have learnt a lot, and hope to learn a lot more about CS here at UIUC.
